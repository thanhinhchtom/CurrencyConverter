# CurrencyConverter
A currency converter created by @UD331, @thanhinhchtom and @waankyu.
Created for the HelloWorld 2021 Hackathon at Purdue.
The converter takes in 3 things- an amount to be converted, the currency to convert it from and the currency to convert it to.
Then the converter takes the amount and multiplies it by a select factor to get the amount in the required currency.
The converter supports 160+ currencies and is updated once a day.
Roughly 1500 requests can be made in a month.
